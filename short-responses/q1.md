# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

A middleware is the layer between the server and the client, in that it will check a request before sending it to the controller. It can also handle requests from multiple static files. Controllers are only responsible for handling requests at specific endpoints.

This is a great explanation Nicole! In the second sentence, I think you meant to say that it can handle requests from multiple "endpoints" since you say in the next sentence that controllers are only responsible for handling requests at specific endpoints. 

I think this is a nice way to compare and contrast middleware and controllers.

One important detail you're missing is that middleware doesn't send responses (typically), they just send the request to the next middleware/controller. Controllers on the other hand ALWAYS send responses.
